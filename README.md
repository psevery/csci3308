A checkers game designed using:
* Express.js
* JavaScript
* JSDoc
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* Socket.IO

Authors:
* Ryan Baten

* Patrick Severy

***
Configuration:

Install node and its package manager, npm.

Run "npm install" in the base project directory (csci3308) to install the project dependencies.

Edit server.js and uncomment either the local hosting or openshift sections

Visit localhost:3000 in your browser to find the links to singleplayer and multiplayer modes.

Visit localhost:3000/test.html to run the current test suite and view its output.

To see documentation generated by jsdoc (our autodoc tech), run "python3 -m http.server 8000" in csci3308/docs,

then visit localhost:8000 to see the documentation website. jsdoc doesn't support generating pdfs,

but we did find a html-to-pdf converter called wkhtmltopdf, which didn't work perfectly,

but we nonetheless added the pdfs to the doc directory, in case you're curious. It is the same content as the jsdoc

website.
